# React-Laravel CRUD Project

A full-stack CRUD application using:

- **React JS** (in `/frontend`) for the frontend
- **Laravel** (in `/backend`) for the backend REST API

This project demonstrates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
